# Mesh
Use existing investments in data platforms and treat them as independent “domains”

Improve data governance by pushing policy down into data domains

Provides a clear mechanism for centralized data discovery

Provides self-service data sharing features to allow domain owners to grant access to consumers

Measure and invest in data products based on usage and business value



## Data mesh: Four core principles
### Data Owner 
Data domain ownership
A data mesh features data domains as nodes, which exist in data lake accounts; it
is founded in decentralization and distribution of data responsibility to people closest to the data

### Data Engineer
Data as a product
A data producer contributes one or more data products to a central catalog in a data
mesh account; DaaP must be autonomous, discoverable, secure, correct, and useable
> Each team manages their data and organizes it as data products
> Each product provides an interface(s) to allow others to interact (e.g., APIs, SQL, reports)
> Remove usability frictions, meet the user where they are
> Provide all supporting metadata, lineage
> Data products are valuable on their own

## Data steward
Federated computational governance
Federated data governance is how data products are shared – delivering
discoverable metadata auditability based on federated decision-making and accountability structures

## Data consumer 
Self-serve sharing
The platform streamlines the experience of data users to discover, access, and use data
products; it streamlines the experience of data providers to build, deploy, and maintain data products
>  Design for generalist majority (i.e., make it easy to use and adopt with no specialist skills needed)
> Enable personas to discover, learn, understand, consume, and maintain data products
> Collection of interoperable data products that enable cross-functional domains to produce and consume data easily and with autonomy, and will allow it to scale
> Data products must include data, metadata, code, and policy all as single unit of value
> Abstract complexity through automation
