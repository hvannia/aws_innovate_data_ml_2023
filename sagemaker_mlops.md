# MLOPS practices

## mapping MLOPs in practice using sagemaker capabilities

### Develop Candidate Model 
- identift goals, KPIs, provision environments, perform experiments

--- see deck 

## Model Governance: SageMaker Model Cards
Standardized environments: Sagemaker projects, use IaC
Sagemaker experiments: Experiment tracker, feature store

## Automated Model TRaining ( Iterative, retraining, full data set)
Automate Model Training: Sagemaker Pipelines
Package and test models: 
Curated features: Sagemaker feature store

store model in mdoel registry

### Deploy and monitor 
Use from SageMaker model registry, can trigger CI/CD
Sagemaker Model monitor

feedback monitoring metrics to Sagemaker model dashboard
